### Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm currently looking for a full-time role in Data Science, Machine Learning or related field. 
Persuing Bechlors of Computer Application @Lovely_Professional_University , Hail and grew up in Jalandhar (Punjab), I'm a Data Science Practitioner who loves to uncover the hidden facts and meaningful insights from messy data. I'm persuing Data Scientist Nanodegree graduate from Udacity where I learned building effective Machine Learning Model, running Data Pipelines, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, building Recommendation Systems, and deploying solutions to the cloud.
I worked at Project Data Analyst IPL-score-prediction , where my primary task was to analyze the dataset and deploy the trained model as front-end.
Personally, I believe in the thought that ‚ÄúTime is the gift that most of us take for granted‚Äù. I love to keep myself busy in gaining new skills and doing freelancing projects on the weekends.
I am working towards a role where I can engage with a group of like-minded people who dream to bring revolution in the world with data.
